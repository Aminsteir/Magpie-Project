## **Amin Armat's Magpie Project**

 - Used for PALCS USP APCS class
 - This is the final repo for the Magpie Project

#### Two ways to finish the project
> private Map<Integer, String> keywords; 
> private Map<Integer, String> responses;

or

> private List<Pair<Integer, String>> keywords; 
> private List<Pair<Integer, String>> responses;

This project implements both HashMap and Lists (both on separate branches) --> HashMap is on the Using-Maps branch and the Lists is on the master branch

Why Use HashMap: the map interface includes both a key and a value, which makes it easier to locate and access values from the files

In order to use Arraylists in this project, we need to use another POJO object called a Pair ( The class can be described better here: [GeeksForGeeks : Pair Class In Java](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/pair-class-in-java/) )

Then you would need to make a helper method to get and retrieve the key and the value (in our case, an integer and a string). 

Anyways, regardless of which method you use, thx!
